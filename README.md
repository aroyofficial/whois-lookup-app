# whois-lookup-app
A full-stack Whois lookup app that fetches domain registration and contact details using the Whois API. The backend processes requests and returns data, while the frontend provides a clean UI for user input and results display. Built with a modern JS framework, it supports error handling and runs locally on port 5000.
